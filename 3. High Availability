To achieve high availability, I moved compute resources into private subnets and introduced an Application Load Balancer (ALB) placed in the public subnets.
User traffic flows:

Client → Internet → ALB (public subnets) → Target Group → EC2 Instances (private subnets via Auto Scaling Group)

I created an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) across two Availability Zones, ensuring instances are automatically replaced if one fails.
The ASG uses a launch template that installs Nginx and deploys the static website at boot, ensuring consistent configuration.
This architecture ensures redundancy, automatic scaling, and secure isolation of application servers.
